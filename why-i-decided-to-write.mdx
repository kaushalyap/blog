# Intro

Back-end 2018, I bought a domain name, modified a [popular SSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) template at the time, wrote some blog posts and eventually abandoned it. At the time I was a fresh college graduate was trying to do what ever other developers were doing.

Fast-forward few years, I have seen the blog posts by many greatest developers, I was wondering why I should write anything at all, since there are many awesome blog post by great engineers that we all love. That's really my imposter syndrome kicking in.

But recently my views on writing had been changing for many different reasons, where some are selfless and some are selfish. Let's break the good news of selfless benefits first.

# Self-less reasons to write

## Each one teach one

How many free blog posts, videos have consumed over your career as a software engineer, which helped you to

- Fix annoying bugs that you encountered,
- Clear up topics that you were struggling with,
- Changing your perspective on a topic,
- Drastically improve your code quality

which may eventually lead you to your next promotion.

But most of the time we just move on, some may an upvote or leave a thankful comment, some nothing. Simple things like an upvote or a thankful comment can go a long way, motivating the author to keep writing.

### Why bother?

#### Paying it forward

We should always try to pay it forward in any way we can. That can be writing a simple post which may add value to other SWEs like us; it does not have to be long, just your unopinionated, objective criticism and work experience can help others in similar situations. While no one may read your blog, but you can go to bed with peace of mind that you have done something in return.

#### Help your fellow devs to have a eureka moment

I believe everyone in this world are unique in their own way, both genetically and life experiences, but still we could still categorize into minor subgroups where there are similarities (minor overlaps). A good example for this would be: some people are allergic to certain types of foods, while the majority is not. Then applying same theory to learning, different people have different learning styles and teaching styles, different dev experiences, so your unique way of writing could reach to the others like you who had similar experiences, yielding eureka comment like

> I wish someone had explained it to me like this years ago

#### Teaching is fascinating!

Related to eureka moment, I was looking at one of Rahul Pandey's video on [Taro](https://jointaro.com/) where he explained the importance of figuring out where your student has the gap to understand the concept fully. (Yeah this is similar to [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)) In my book I would say this is kind of debugging, but for minds, which is fascinating. Not to mention, writing and reading is a transformation of someone thoughts to the thoughts of the reader.

#### Teaching is rewarding!

You may have read the stories of poor kids, war veterans, ex-cons learning to code on online for free and becoming successful software engineers who take care of their loved ones, sick mom or dad, keeping food on the table for their family. Now remember, you could be someone who helped their journey, which will help you to sleep sound at night. The situation of your readers does not have to be that dramatic but you could help a fellow dev to clear up a topic he/she was struggling with.

# Selffish reasons to write

## To understand better

Writing about topics you are learning

- Forces you to understand the topic deeply, thus making your fill you knowledge gaps. Sometimes your knowledge gaps become evident when you try to explain it to someone, like described in Feymann technique.

Additionally

- By sharing your post with others allow you to see different perspectives and know others experience about the topic which make you well-rounded.
- Retain what you wrote by creating new long term memories.

## Improve your writing and thinking skills

The ability to clearly articulate your thoughts in a way others can understand is a crucial skill for knowledge workers. When you practice this kind of deep research, it helps you to be better communicator since you develop skills like

- **Exploration**: Analyzing different strategies and trade-offs of solutions.
- **Articulation**: Forming a clear condense logical narrative.
- **Reflection**: Looking back, what went better, what could be improved

These skills eventually improve your critical thinking, generate more ideas which help you to uncover more optimizations and edge cases of a particular solution.

## Horizontally scaling yourself

Everyone have limited number of hours per day that you can write code, even if you write code for all those hours still your scalability is 1, but if you write something that the rest of the team use, your work scales to number of members on the team who is reading your work.

Before writing technical docs, you could write some rigorous blog posts which can act as practice ground for writing great technical docs.

## To land your next promotion

When you are climbing the ladder to senior roles, writing skills are crucial to scale your impact. Writing design docs, technical documentation can scale your impact from 1->1 to 1-> thousands, since these make onboarding a breeze and get others up to speed with fewer struggles, which increase your chance of getting further promoted.

Also blogging in public can expose you to your next employer if one of your posts reached mass attention. Even if you did not, just place a link to your blog in your resume. This can improve your chances of landing new opportunities when competing with candidates who have the same skill-set, since it shows your interest and dedication towards the domain.

While some may consider technical writing (docs, RFCs) as only valuable form of writing, but things like git commit messages, issue or review comments, Q&A and wikis are also valuable form of writing.
